The Global Minimum Variance Portfolio
The GVMP approach will be used in selecting the optimal weights for the four assets. MV portfolio is a non-constraint mean variance optimization strategy which is on the left most tip of the mean variance efficient frontier, the global minimum variance portfolio is the assets portfolio with lowest risk or variance on the minimum variance frontier.

Using the Regression Method we have

Ticker	AMZN	FB	GOOGL      	MSFT

Weights (%)	59.62531	-6.531495	74.41513	-27.50895

A negative portfolio weight indicate you should short sell. Short selling implies to borrow the stock now and Sell it later. You must then purchase the stock at a later date to repay the borrowed stock.
